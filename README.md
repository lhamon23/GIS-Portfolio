# GIS-Portfolio
Portfolio for Advanced GIS

## About me
Hi! My name is Laura, and I'm about to graduate with an MSc. in Public Policy & Management. I'm originally from Bogot√°, Colombia but lived in Mexico for the last four years before attending Carnegie Mellon University. Before attending graduate school, I worked as a policy consultant for 5+ years in Mexico and Colombia. The projects I worked in were related to diagnosing social problems implementing, designing, and evaluating public policies in **education, innovation, security, justice, and economic development**. This experience made me realize how relevant geospatial analysis was for approaching these issues. During my master's, I have used GIS to create a geospatial analysis of the relationship between security perception and security indicators and confidence in the institutions in Mexico.

## What I hope to learn
I hope to improve my capabilities using GIS by including more sophisticated statistical analysis in my maps and developing more relevant and exciting geospatial analysis. I am also looking forward to exploring other tools for creating maps out of ESRI and in public platforms that could be more accessible for organizations in Latin America.

### Custom Map for Botellas de Amor

One of the first issues that was addressed in the course was the creation of personalized/custom maps for an organization. In this case I decided to create a custom map for Botellas de Amor, a Colombian NGO that works in reducing waste by creating new materials out of plastic bottles with non reciclable waste.

### Final Project: Creating a predictive model for identifying high risk municipalities for social leaders in Colombia

This exploratory project attempts to create a predictive model by using the forest-based classification and regression tool included in ArcGIS Pro. This model will enable the identification of the municipalities in which leaders might have a higher risk of facing threats or even being murdered.

One of the biggest challenges I faced when using this geopsatial tool was the lack of complete data for all of the initial variables that I wante to include in the model. Since different crimes tahta are not thata common were included in the first model the tool could not run due to a lack of information. Oncce correcting that issue the model did not seem to throw significant result. However, further analysis was done to mention potential next steps to improve this exploratory exercise.
