# GIS-Portfolio
Portfolio for Advanced GIS

## About me
Hi! My name is Laura, and I'm about to graduate with an MSc. in Public Policy & Management. I'm originally from Bogot√°, Colombia but lived in Mexico for the last four years before attending Carnegie Mellon University. Before attending graduate school, I worked as a policy consultant for 5+ years in Mexico and Colombia. The projects I worked in were related to diagnosing social problems implementing, designing, and evaluating public policies in **education, innovation, security, justice, and economic development**. This experience made me realize how relevant geospatial analysis was for approaching these issues. During my master's, I have used GIS to create a geospatial analysis of the relationship between security perception and security indicators and confidence in the institutions in Mexico.

## What I hope to learn
I hope to improve my capabilities using GIS by including more sophisticated statistical analysis in my maps and developing more relevant and exciting geospatial analysis. I am also looking forward to exploring other tools for creating maps out of ESRI and in public platforms that could be more accessible for organizations in Latin America. 

## Portfolio

### Custom Map for Botellas de Amor

One of the first issues that was addressed in the course was the creation of personalized/custom maps for an organization. In this case I decided to create a custom map for Botellas de Amor, a Colombian NGO that works in reducing waste by creating new materials out of plastic bottles with non reciclable waste.

### Getting familiar with ArcGIS Insights by exploring the DEA pain pill database

The data set on pain pills offered exciting options for analysis. In the case of Mingo County, identifying the distribution nodes is interesting since it enables one to understand the distances that the medicines undergo to arrive at the different pharmacies that distribute in the county. It is also interesting to identify the county's pills distribution concentration and reduced number of distributors. This shows that these distributors concentrate on a high rate of distribution of pain pills in the county. One of the most valuable takeaways of this exercise is the usefulness of link maps. In this case, the fact that the links represent the magnitude of the dosage distributed among nodes enables an understanding of the breadth of the distribution channels.

This is one of the final visualization of the link map obtained in this exercise are:

Additionally, the final output of this assignment was the creation of a presentation showing the pros and cons of ArcGIS Insights. The presentation is available in: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12ZtGk8vgCl3mWXjHDn_UZWwGOAXjJy2K/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116221328138111940294&rtpof=true&sd=true

### Exploring ArcGIS Spatial Data Science MOOCS

#### Data Engineering and visualization - Using Notebooks

The exercises were great opportunities to understand new features that I wasn't aware ArcGIS had. The usage of notebooks and the data engineering tools provide new options for collaborating when using GIS and regarding the type of processes that can be done in the program. Altogether, these exercises showed me that ArcGIS could also be a program for data processing and creating relevant and attractive data visualizations. 

Some scenarios where I identified additional opportunities for the use of Notebooks were: 1) Data preparation for spatial analysis and 2) 
Collaborating with teams. In regards to the features for using more advanced graphing capabilities in the software, I think I can employ them in the future for: 1)
Doing an exploratory analysis of my statistics in ArcGIS, 2) Creating relevant visualizations and making filtering easier, and 3) Exploring bivariate relationships within a map.

#### Prediction Models

This was my first approach to prediction models and the inspiration for my final project (see next section). One of the most exciting possibilities I have explored while using GIS is creating a prediction model to forecast, downscale, or replace missing values. I used to think these processes were strictly confined to statistical software that usually required more complex work and advanced knowledge of statistical tools. It's nice to know that ArcGIS Pro enables exploring geospatial data using advanced statistical tools. I was also impressed that predictive analysis could be that easily represented geographically - the exercise on how voter turnout could look in the future is an advantageous way to visualize the complexity of a predictive model. This way of displaying data is a fantastic tool for easing data communication with someone who is not necessarily a data expert.

### Final Project: Creating a predictive model for identifying high risk municipalities for social leaders in Colombia

This exploratory project attempts to create a predictive model by using the forest-based classification and regression tool included in ArcGIS Pro. This model will enable the identification of the municipalities in which leaders might have a higher risk of facing threats or even being murdered.

One of the biggest challenges I faced when using this geopsatial tool was the lack of complete data for all of the initial variables that I wante to include in the model. Since different crimes tahta are not thata common were included in the first model the tool could not run due to a lack of information. Oncce correcting that issue the model did not seem to throw significant result. However, further analysis was done to mention potential next steps to improve this exploratory exercise.

## Closing Remarks

This course provided me with new elements to keep exploring ArcGIS capabilities. At this point I have learnt the extent of the statistical analysis that can be performed directly in the platform and even exploring innovative features that the program offers. I'm looking forward to keep on exploring ESRI's tools for data analysis.
