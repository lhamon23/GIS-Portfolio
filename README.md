# GIS-Portfolio
Portfolio for Advanced GIS

## About me
Hi! My name is Laura, and I'm about to graduate with an MSc. in Public Policy & Management. I'm originally from Bogot√°, Colombia but lived in Mexico for the last four years before attending Carnegie Mellon University. Before attending graduate school, I worked as a policy consultant for 5+ years in Mexico and Colombia. The projects I worked in were related to diagnosing social problems implementing, designing, and evaluating public policies in **education, innovation, security, justice, and economic development**. This experience made me realize how relevant geospatial analysis was for approaching these issues. During my master's, I have used GIS to create a geospatial analysis of the relationship between security perception and security indicators and confidence in the institutions in Mexico.

## What I hope to learn
I hope to improve my capabilities using GIS by including more sophisticated statistical analysis in my maps and developing more relevant and exciting geospatial analysis. I am also looking forward to exploring other tools for creating maps out of ESRI and in public platforms that could be more accessible for organizations in Latin America.
