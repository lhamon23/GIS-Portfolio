# GIS-Portfolio
Portfolio for Advanced GIS

## About me
Hi! My name is Laura, and I'm about to graduate with an MSc. in Public Policy & Management. I have used GIS in the past to make a geospatial analysis of the relationship between security perception and security indicators and confidence in the institutions in Mexico.

## What I hope to learn
I hope to improve my capabilities using GIS and explore other tools for creating maps and attaching statistical analysis to maps.
