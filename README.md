# GIS-Portfolio
Portfolio for Advanced GIS

## About me
Hi! My name is Laura, and I'm about to graduate with an MSc. in Public Policy & Management. I'm originally from Bogot√°, Colombia but lived in Mexico for the last four years before attending Carnegie Mellon University. Before attending graduate school, I worked as a policy consultant for 5+ years in Mexico and Colombia. The projects I worked in were related to diagnosing social problems implementing, designing, and evaluating public policies in education, innovation, security, justice, and economic development. This experience made me realize how relevant geospatial analysis was for approaching these issues. During my master's, I have used GIS to create a geospatial analysis of the relationship between security perception and security indicators and confidence in the institutions in Mexico.

## What I hope to learn
I hope to improve my capabilities using GIS by including more sophisticated statistical analysis in my maps and developing more relevant and exciting geospatial analysis. I am also looking forward to exploring other tools for creating maps out of ESRI and in public platforms that could be more accessible for organizations in Latin America.
